/**
 * \brief The configuration settings for the \c SensorView to be provided
 * by the environment simulation.
 *
 * This message can be provided by the sensor model to the environment
 * simulation, in which case it describes the input configuration that
 * is desired by the sensor model. In response the environment simulation
 * will configure the input and provide a new message of this type, which
 * describes the actual configuration that it is going to employ. The two
 * can and will differ, when either the environment simulation does not
 * support a given requested configuration, and/or when the requested
 * configuration allowed for multiple alternatives, in which case the set
 * configuration will only contain the alternative chosen.
 *
 * It should be noted that this message is not intended to provide for
 * parametrization of a generic sensor model, but rather for the automatic
 * configuration of an environment simulation in order to supply the
 * necessary input to it, depending on its actual configuration.
 * Mechanisms to parametrize sensor models are currently packaging-specific,
 * i.e. they depend on the packaging mechanism chosen:  For FMU-packaging
 * the parametrization can be implemented using normal FMU parameters,
 * and the requested \c SensorViewConfiguration can depend on those parameter
 * values by being defined as a calculatedParameter.
 *
 * The sensor-technology specific configurations are intended to allow
 * sensor models to use useful sensor modeling base capabilities of the
 * environment simulation (e.g. ray tracing engines, camera/lens image
 * generation), which need configuration by the sensor model to supply
 * suitable data. The specified details are not directly related to
 * sensor details, but rather provide the necessary base machinery
 * setup so that the data provided is suitable to model the sensor to
 * a sufficient degree of fidelity internally. For example the number
 * of rays parameters for the Lidar configuration does not match one to
 * one with the number of laser rays a lidar sensor might cast, but
 * rather specifies the number of rays being cast by a ray
 * casting/tracing engine, which might be many more than the physical
 * rays being cast at any point in time.
 *
 * This also implies that for sensors that have dynamically varying
 * characteristics (e.g. switching between wide and narrow focus,
 * switching update rates, etc.), the basic approach is to specify
 * the maximum amount of data needed at all times here, and internally
 * select the data that is needed at any point in time.
 *
 * In order to optimize the workload and bandwidth needed for sensor
 * simulation, OSI packaging mechanisms can specify the ability to
 * exchange \c SensorViewConfiguration messages not only prior to
 * simulation startup, but also dynamically during simulation runs,
 * thereby allowing dynamic input configuration switching to only
 * request data that is needed in the current sensor mode. However
 * this is more or less only a resource optimization strategy, and
 * since providing fine-grained information like this can reveal
 * internal characteristics of the sensor and/or sensor model, will
 * not always be the preferred approach for reasons of IP protection.
