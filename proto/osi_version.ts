/**
 * \brief The interface version number.
 *
 * The field denoting the version number. This needs to be set by the
 * sender to the actual OSI version that is to be sent.  Code wanting to
 * access the version number of the OSI code base can access a FileOptions,
 * which has the proper values, like this:
 *
 * \code
 * auto currentInterfaceVersion =
 *   InterfaceVersion::descriptor()->file()->options().GetExtension(current_interface_version);
 * \endcode
 *
 * If a message with all components set to the default value 0 is
 * received, this indicates that either that the message was sent by
 * a version 2.2.0 or earlier release, or that the sender did not
 * properly set the version components prior to sending.
 *
 * Increments will happen as part of changes to the whole interface.
 * The meaning of different InterfaceVersions is defined in [1].
