/**
 * \brief The ground truth information from the simulation environment.
 *
 * This ground truth information is supposed to describe the whole simulated
 * environment around any simulated vehicle. For each simulated host vehicle
 * (there may be one or multiple), define an area around the vehicle which
 * is greater than the combined field of views (FOV) of all obstructed sensors
 * in the vehicle. The ground truth data is supposed to describe the convex
 * hull of all such areas w.r.t. a global simulation coordinate system.
 *
 * The simulation coordinate system may change during the simulation if and
 * only if all coordinates w.r.t. this coordinate system are also changed.
 *
 * The data has to be sent at a rate defined by the receiving partner. When
 * sending, values with default values might be left default in order to improve
 * performance.
 *
 * To provide a complete interface, all fields of all contained messages must be
 * properly set unless specifically stated in the field's definition that the
 * field may remain unset.
 *
 * In enums (e.g. types) the unknown (first / default) value is not allowed to
 * be used in the ground truth interface.
