/**
 * Definition of discretized ambient illumination states:
 * Ambient light is any light in the vehicle's environment that is not
 * emitted by the vehicle itself. It can include sun/moon light, light from
 * other cars, street lights etc.
 *
 * Lux [lx] is the SI unit of luminance or illumination of an area of exact
 * one square meter, which is equal to one lumen per square meter 1 [lx] =
 * 1 [lm/m^2] [5].
 * The lumen [lm] is the SI derived unit of luminous flux and a measure of
 * the total quantity of visible light emitted by a source. The lumen is
 * defined in relation to the candela [cd] as 1 [lm] =1 [cd sr] where [sr]
 * denotes steradian, the unit of solid angle used in 3D geometry analogous
 * to the radian.
 *
 * Categorization is done based on natural day/night time illuminance levels
 * [6] and standards for required lighting levels on roads [6, 7, 8, 9].
